Gonna be honest, I have absolutely no recollection how this works.

Either way, you'll need to dump items from the datacenter. I recommend
[`TeraDataTools`](https://github.com/gothos-folly/TeraDataTools). This script
doesn't take any input, so you'll need to specify the path to the `data/json/`
directory in `index.js` itself where `basedir` is defined. Then just run it and
collect your `items.json`.
